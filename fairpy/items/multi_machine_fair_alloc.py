implementation of Optimally Scheduling Small Numbers of Identical Parallel Machines(2013)
Author: Richard E. Korf and Ethan L. Schreiber

Programer: Liora Pinkhasov
This algorythm takes a sorted list of numbers with size n and a number k for the number of bins we need to split to, and sorts the numbers so that the sum of numbers in each bin will be closest to each other.
